Audited the Marketing Analytics class taught as part of the Executive MBA program at UNC.

Only two assignments are shown here (one of which is in progress).

Description of the class:
In today’s technology enabled world, organizations collect wealth of information as a part of their business operations. Marketing Analytics is a systematic approach to harnessing this data and information to drive effective marketing decision making. We will learn to analyze historical data, market research data, and competitive information for making strategic marketing decisions.

This analytical case based course aims to provide you with tools and techniques that will help you to make numerous decisions as: how to analyze consumer choice behavior, how to segment the market, which segments should be targeted, how to position the product in customers’ minds, which attributes to include/ exclude in a new product, how to forecast sales of new products, how much to spend on advertising, and how to evaluate marketing performance. Each of these decisions will be made using analytic tools that are very often used by marketers in the real world. These decision analytic tools will help us generate useful insights about customer preferences, consumer behavior, and competitive market actions.
